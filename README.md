# Care to Share? Android and web app

Copy of final group project for Software Design and Engineering

Created to help eliminate food waste, Care to Share? aims to connect donors (event planners, restaurants, catering businesses) that have leftover food at the end of the day, with "obtainers" (homeless shelters, food banks, etc.) that are in need of food donations. These users are split between two different types of accounts so that donors can create posts about food availability that are visible by obtainers, and so that obtainers can make "claims" on these donations to be approved by the donor.
